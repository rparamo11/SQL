Data Provided by Chicago Police Department 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ETL Process: 
1. Downloaded data from the Chicago Data Portal website. 
2. Got familiar with the data and analyzed it before making any edits to the table. 
3. Made a copy of the raw data in order to make edits to the data itself. 
4. Removed duplicates.
5. Date column converted to DATE mmddyyyy, thus removing the TIME. 
6. Deleted columns IUCR, Beat, Ward, Community Area, FBI Code and Updated On. 
7. Edited values in the Primary Type column to merge similar values together. 
8. Looked up the district names to match the District column numbers on the chicagopolice.org website. 
    I created an IF statment to look up values that match district numbers on the Chicago Police website. 
9. Saved document as CSV.
10. Imported CSV document to SQLite Studio.
